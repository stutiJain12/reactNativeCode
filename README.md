Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you manage application state in a consistent way, making it easier to handle complex state logic and debug your application. Redux works by using a single store to hold the entire state of your app. Actions are dispatched to describe state changes, and reducers handle these actions to update the state accordingly. By integrating Redux with React Native, you can keep your app's state predictable and manageable, leading to better maintainability and scalability.

For more details, check out the Redux documentation.

Feel free to adjust this description based on your project's specific needs or the level of detail you want to provide.
